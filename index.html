                <p>Gemini is one of the constellations of the zodiac and is located in the northern celestial
                    hemisphere. It was one of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd century AD astronomer Ptolemy,
                    and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations today. Its name is Latin for twins, and it is
                    associated with the twins Castor and Pollux in Greek mythology. Its old astronomical symbol is
                    Gemini symbol (♊︎). </p>

                <p>Gemini lies between Taurus to the west and Cancer to the east, with Auriga and Lynx to the north,
                    Monoceros and Canis Minor to the south and Orion to the south-west.

                    In classical antiquity, Cancer was the location of the Sun on the first day of summer (June 21).
                    During the first century AD, axial precession shifted it into Gemini. In 1990, the location of the
                    Sun on the first day of summer moved from Gemini into Taurus, where it will remain until the 27th
                    century AD and then move into Aries. The Sun will move through Gemini from June 21 to July 20
                    through 2062.

                    In Babylonian astronomy, the stars Castor and Pollux were known as the Great Twins. The Twins were
                    regarded as minor gods and were called Meshlamtaea and Lugalirra, meaning respectively 'The One who
                    has arisen from the Underworld' and the 'Mighty King'. Both names can be understood as titles of
                    Nergal, the major Babylonian god of plague and pestilence, who was king of the Underworld.

                    Gemini is dominated by Castor and Pollux, two bright stars that appear relatively very closely
                    together
                    forming an o shape, encouraging the mythological link between the constellation and twinship. The
                    twin
                    above and to the right (as seen from the Northern Hemisphere) is Castor, whose brightest star is α
                    Gem;
                    it is a second-magnitude star and represents Castor's head. The twin below and to the left is
                    Pollux,
                    whose brightest star is β Gem (more commonly called Pollux); it is of the first magnitude and
                    represents
                    Pollux's head. Furthermore, the other stars can be visualized as two parallel lines descending from
                    the
                    two main stars, making it look like two figures.
